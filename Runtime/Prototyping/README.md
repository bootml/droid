# Prototyping

The submodule of the droid package enables rapid prototyping, the user simply add prebuilt Components to GameObjects, configures them for the particular task and done, _no scripting required_. Agent can now either observe, act or evaluate in environment and much more..  

A future version of the submodule will be an ECS implementation, benefiting from the batched run over many components.
